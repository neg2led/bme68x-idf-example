# bme68x-idf-example

example of how to use my [bme68x-idf](https://github.com/neg2led/bme68x-idf) component, using a hacked up version of [UncleRus/esp-idf-lib](https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib)'s i2cdev component


this has been tested to compile on an esp32-c3 but it has not been tested to, you know, *actually work*


needs ESP-IDF master, probably, or at least v4.3beta
